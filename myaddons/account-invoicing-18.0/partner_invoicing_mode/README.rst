This is a base module for implementing different invoicing mode for
customers. It adds a selection field invoicing_mode in the Invoicing tab
(if enterprise account_accountant is installed -> Accounting tab) of the
partner with a default value (Odoo standard invoicing mode).

It can be used on its own to generate automatically (e.g.: each day) the
invoices for standard invoicing mode.

In core, Odoo is grouping invoicing from a group of sale orders on:

- Company
- Partner
- Currency

This module uses grouping on those keys:

- Company
- Invoiced partner
- Currency
- Payment term (as this can be selected on sale order level)

The following modules use it to install specific invoicing mode :

   - partner_invoicing_mode_at_shipping
   - partner_invoicing_mode_monthly
   - partner_invoicing_mode_weekly

Usage
=====

- To enable the invoices automatic generation, enable the developer
  mode, go to Settings > Automation > Scheduled Actions
- Filter the archived actions and activate 'Generate Standard Invoices'.
- Adapt the frequency you want to automatically generate invoices to
  your needs.
- The field 'Next Invoice Date' on partner form indicates when the next
  invoice generation will take place.
- To manually change the invoicing group (one invoice per order), go to
  the Sale Order > Other Information > Invoicing and Payments and check
  the 'One Invoice Per Order' box.
