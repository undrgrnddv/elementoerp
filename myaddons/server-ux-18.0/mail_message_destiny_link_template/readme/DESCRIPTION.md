This module provides an email template to show which target records have been modified by a source record.

Example: When a purchase order generates an invoice, the invoice contains a message indicating its origin with a link to the purchase order. However, the purchase order does not log any message stating that it has generated an invoice. This module allows developers to implement that functionality by providing a ready-to-use template.

⚠️ This module does not add functionality by itself. It is part of the server-ux repository and is intended for developers, who can implement the provided template as needed. The module includes an example code snippet to illustrate how to use it.
