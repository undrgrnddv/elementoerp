1. **Create an Asset Profile**:  
   Navigate to **Configuration -> Asset Profiles** and create a new profile.

2. **Create a Vendor Bill**:  
   - Go to **Vendors -> Bills** and create a new bill.
   - Add a product and select the asset profile you just created.  
   - The Asset Account will be derived from the profile or can be manually updated at this step (the invoice account will be used as the Asset Account).
   - Set the product price and confirm the bill.

3. **Asset Creation**:  
   Once the bill is confirmed, the asset will be created and populated with the associated accounts. You can now manually adjust the **Depreciation Account** and **Depreciation Expense Account** if necessary.
